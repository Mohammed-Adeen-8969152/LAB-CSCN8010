# LAB 3 - Vanilla CNN and Fine-Tune VGG16 - for Dogs and Cats Classification

### Introduction:

In this lab, we will work through a common practice of Deep Learning Engineers - that is - take an existing model, that does something similar to what the engineer is interested doing, and fine-tune it for the specific task at-hand.
