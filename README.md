# LAB1-Univariate-Linear-Regression

### Introduction:

This repo is a lab work showcase and report that focuses on building and analyzing a univariate Linear Regression Model to solve the relationship between median house value with three other variables (Median Income, Population and Number of Households) 

The dataset is taken from Kaggle:<b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices"> California Housing Prices Dataset </a> </b>

# Lab2-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-Non-Parametric-Models-and-Cross-Validation
We are trying find the dependent variable <b>'Disease progression one year after baseline'</b> using different ML models and use cross-validation to evaluate all the models and select the best one based on performance metrics like <b>R-squared</b>, <b>MAPE</b>, and <b>MAE

# LAB 3 - Vanilla CNN and Fine-Tune VGG16 - for Dogs and Cats Classification

### Introduction:

In this lab, we will work through a common practice of Deep Learning Engineers - that is - take an existing model, that does something similar to what the engineer is interested doing, and fine-tune it for the specific task at-hand.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle:<b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats"> Dogs vs Cats Dataset </a> </b>
